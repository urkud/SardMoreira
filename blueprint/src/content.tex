\section{Measure Theory}%
\label{sec:measure-theory}

Most of the lemmas in this section
are true for measures on general measurable spaces
with appropriate typeclass assumptions.
\texttt{Mathlib} versions of these lemmas should be stated
in the right generality.
However, for this project, it's acceptable to prove the lemmas
for Haar measures on finite dimensional real normed spaces only.

\begin{lemma}%
  \label{lem:measurable-meas-ball}
  \lean{Measurable.measure_apply}
  \leanok%
  Let \(E\) and \(F\) be finite dimensional real normed spaces.
  Let \(s \subset E \times F\) be a measurable set in their product.
  Let \(\mu\) be an additive Haar measure on \(E\).
  Then \(\varphi(x, y, r) = \mu \{z \in E\mid \|z - x\| < r \wedge (z, y) \in s\}\)
  is a measurable function in \((x, y, r)\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \leanok%
  Consider the set \(t \subset E \times E \times F \times \mathbb R\)
  given by \(t = \{(z, x, y, r) \mid \|z - x\| < r \wedge (z, y) \in s\}\).
  Clearly, this is a measurable set.
  Thus the measure of its sections \(t_{x, y, r}=\{z \mid (z, x, y, r) \in t\}\)
  is a measurable function of \((x, y, r)\),
  which is exactly what we need to prove.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}%
  \label{cor:measurable-density}
  \lean{Besicovitch.ae_tendsto_measure_sectl_inter_closedBall_div}
  \leanok%
  Let \(E\), \(F\), \(s\), and \(\mu\) be as in \autoref{lem:measurable-meas-ball}.
  Then the set of points \((x, y)\) such that \(x\) is a Lebesgue density point of \(s_{y} = \{z \mid (z, y) \in s\}\)
  is a measurable set.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{lem:measurable-meas-ball}
  \leanok%
  The theorem immediately follows from the non-parametrized version
  and measurability of the set of fiberwise density points of a measurable set.
\end{proof}

\section{\(C^k\) maps}%
\label{sec:ck-maps}

\section{\(C^{k}\) maps with locally Hölder derivatives}

In this section,
\begin{itemize}
\item \(k\) is a natural number;
\item \(\alpha\) is a real number between \(0\) and \(1\);
\item \(E\), \(F\), and \(G\) a real normed spaces;
\item \(f\colon E \to F\) is a function.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}%
  \label{def:cdh-at}
  We say that a map \(f\colon E\to F\) is \emph{\(C^{k+(\alpha)}\)} at a point \(a\),
  if it is \(C^{k}\) at \(a\) and \(D^{k}f(x) - D^{k}f(a) = O(\|x - a\|^{\alpha})\) as \(x\to a\).
\end{definition}

Note that this notion is weaker than a more commonly used \(C^{k+\alpha}\) smoothness assumption.
\begin{lemma}%
  \label{def:contdiffholder-imp-cdh-at}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  If \(f\colon E \to F\) is \(C^{k+\alpha}\) on an open set \(U\),
  i.e., \(f\) is \(C^{k}\) on \(U\) and \(D^{k}f\) is \(\alpha\)-Hölder on \(U\),
  then \(f\) is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at every point \(a \in U\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The proof follows immediately from definitions.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}%
  \label{lem:cdh-at-zero}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  A map \(f\colon E\to F\) is \(C^{k+(0)}\) at \(a\) iff it is \(C^{k}\) at \(a\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The forward implication follows from the definition.
  For the backward implication,
  we need to show that \(D^{k}f(x) - D^{k}f(a)=O(1)\) as \(x\to a\),
  which immediately follows from the continuity of \(D^{k}f\) at \(a\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}%
  \label{lem:cdh-at-mono}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  Let \(f\colon E\to F\) be a map which is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at \(a\).
  Let \(l\) be a natural number and \(\beta \in [0, 1]\) be a real number.
  If \((l, \beta) \le (k, \alpha)\) in the lexicographic order,
  then \(f\) is \(C^{l+(\beta)}\) at \(a\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Note that \(l\le k\), hence \(f\) is \(C^{l}\) at \(a\).
  In order to show \(D^{l}f(x) - D^{l}f(a) = O(\|x - a\|^{\beta})\) as \(x\to a\),
  consider the cases \(l = k\), \(\beta \le \alpha\) and \(l < k\).

  In the former case, we have \(D^{k}f(x) - D^{k}f(a) = O\left(\|x - a\|^{\alpha}\right)=O\left(\|x - a\|^{\beta}\right)\) as \(x\to a\).

  In the latter case, \(D^{l}f\) is differentiable at \(a\), hence \(D^{l}f(x)-D^{l}f(a)=O(x - a)=O(\|x - a\|^{\beta})\),
  where the latter estimate holds since \(\beta \le 1\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}%
  \label{lem:cdh-at-of-contDiffAt}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  If \(f\colon E\to F\) is \(C^{l}\) at \(a\) with \(l > k\),
  then it is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at \(a\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{lem:cdh-at-mono, lem:cdh-at-zero}
  This lemma immediately follows
  from \autoref{lem:cdh-at-mono} and \autoref{lem:cdh-at-zero}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}%
  \label{lem:cdh-at-comp}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  Consider \(g\colon F \to G\), \(f\colon E \to F\), and \(a \in E\)
  such that \(g\) is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at \(f(a)\) and \(f\) is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at \(a\), where \(k > 0\).
  Then \(g\circ f\) is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at \(a\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Since \(g\) is \(C^{k}\) at \(f(a)\) and \(f\) is \(C^{k}\) at \(a\),
  the composition \(g\circ f\) is \(C^{k}\) at \(a\).
  Let us show that \(D^{k}(g\circ f)(x) - D^{k}(g\circ f)(a) = O(\|x - a\|^{\alpha})\) as \(x\to \alpha\).

  Due to the Faa Di Bruno formula, we have
  \[
    D^k(g\circ f)(a) = \sum_{P}TC_{P}\left(D^{|P|}g(f(a)), D^{|P_{0}|}f(a), \dots, D^{\left|P_{|P|-1}\right|}f(a)\right),
  \]
  where the sum is taken over all partitions \(P\) of \(0, \dots, k - 1\) into disjoint sets,
  and \(TC_{P}\) is a continuous multilinear map in all \(|P|+1\) variables
  which depends only on the normed spaces and the partition \(P\).

  Subtracting these expressions, we see that it suffices to show that for each partition \(P\),
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    TC_{P}&\left(D^{|P|}g(f(x)), D^{|P_{0}|}f(x), \dots, D^{\left|P_{|P|-1}\right|}f(x)\right) -\\
          &TC_{P}\left(D^{|P|}g(f(a)), D^{|P_{0}|}f(a), \dots, D^{\left|P_{|P|-1}\right|}f(a)\right) =\\
          &O(\|x - a\|^{\alpha}).
  \end{align*}
  Since \(k > 0\), the function \(f\) is Lipschitz near \(a\),
  thus \(f(x) - f(a) = O(x - a)\), \(D^{|P|}g(f(x)) - D^{|P|}g(f(a)) = O(\|x - a\|^{\alpha})\), and \(D^{|P_{j}|}f(x) - D^{|P_{j}|}f(a) = O(\|x - a\|^{\alpha})\).
  Now, the goal follows from the fact that a continuous multilinear map is locally Lipschitz.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}%
  \label{cor:cdh-at-arith}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, multiplication)
  of \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) functions is a \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) function.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{lem:cdh-at-comp,lem:cdh-at-of-contDiffAt}
  This fact immediately follows
  from \autoref{lem:cdh-at-comp} and \autoref{lem:cdh-at-of-contDiffAt}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  It would be nice to formalize the proofs of \autoref{lem:cdh-at-comp} above
  and \autoref{thm:cdh-at-inverse} below
  so that most parts of the proofs
  can be reused in the proofs about a more common class \(C^{k+\alpha}\).
  This can be achieved by writing most of the estimates
  in terms of formal Taylor series satisfying the Faa Di Bruno formula.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}%
  \label{lem:cdh-at-sub-affine-isBigO}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  If \(f\colon E \to F\) is \(C^{1+(\alpha)}\) at \(a\),
  then \(f(x) - f(a) - Df(a)(x - a) = O\left(\|x - a\|^{\alpha}\right)\) as \(x \to a\).
\end{lemma}
Here \(Df(a)(x - a)\) means differential of \(f\) at \(a\) applied to \(x - a\).

\begin{definition}%
  \label{def:cdh-near}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  We say that a map \(f\colon E\to F\) is \emph{\(C^{k+(\alpha)}\)} near a set \(s\),
  if it is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\)-smooth at all points of \(s\).
  Note that this definition depends on the values of \(f\) near \(s\), not only on \(s\).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}%
  \label{lem:cdh-on-nhds-iff-open}
  \uses{def:cdh-near}
  A map \(f\colon E\to F\) is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) near \(s\)
  if and only if there exits an open superset \(U\supset s\)
  such that \(f\) is \(C^{k}\) on \(U\)
  and for any \(a \in s\) we have \(D^{k}f(x) - D^{k}f(a) = o(\|x - a\|^{\alpha})\) as \(x\to a\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The reverse implication is trivial, we just take \(U\) as the neighborhood of each \(a \in s\) required in the definition.
  For the forward implication, choose an open neighborhood \(U_{a}\) of each \(a \in s\) such that \(f\) is \(C^{k}\) on \(U_{a}\).
  Then \(f\) is \(C^{k}\) on \(U = \bigcup_{a \in s} U_{a}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  In the original paper, the definition of a \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) map
  involves an open set \(U\) and its subset \(K\subset U\).
  However, we use a definition that does not fix \(U\) instead
  and prove equivalence of two definitions in \autoref{lem:cdh-on-nhds-iff-open}.
\end{remark}

\section{Vitali Families}%
\label{sec:vitali-families}

\section{Inverse function theorem}%
\label{sec:inverse-funct-theor}

In this section we prove a version of the inverse function theorem for \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) functions,
then deduce some corollaries.

\begin{theorem}%
  \label{thm:cdh-at-inverse}
  \uses{def:cdh-at}
  Consider a map \(f\colon E\to F\) between two finite dimensional real normed spaces.
  Suppose that \(f\) is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at \(a \in E\), \(k > 0\), and \(df(a)\) is bijective.
  Then the inverse function \(f^{-1}\) is \(C^{k+(\alpha)}\) at \(f(a)\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  From the usual inverse function theorem for \(C^{k}\) maps,
  we know that \(g=f^{-1}\) is \(C^{k}\) in a neighborhood of \(f(a)\).
  Thus we only need to show that \(D^{k}g(y)-D^{k}g(f(a)) = O\left(\|y - f(a)\|^{\alpha}\right)\) as \(y \to f(a)\).
  Equivalently, we need to show that \(D^{k}g(f(x)) - D^{k}g(f(a)) = O\left(\|x - a\|^{\alpha}\right)\) as \(x\to a\).

  Consider the cases \(k = 1\) and \(k > 1\).

  \textbf{Case I:\@\(k = 1\)}. In this case we need to show that
  \(g'(f(x)) - g'(f(a)) = O\left(\|x - a\|^{\alpha}\right)\) as \(x\to a\).
  This immediately follows from \(g'(f(x)) = {f'(x)}^{-1}\),
  a similar estimate on \(f'(x) - f'(a)\),
  and differentiability of the inversion of a continuous linear equivalence.

  \textbf{Case II:\@\(k > 1\)}.
  Apply the Faa Di Bruno formula to find \(D^{k}(g \circ f) = D^{k} id =0\).
  Note that the only term in the RHS of the Faa Di Bruno formula
  that depends on \(D^{k}g\) is \(D^{k}g\circ_{k} f'\),
  where \(\circ_{k}\) means composition of a continuous multilinear map \(D^{k}g\)
  and a continuous linear map \(f'\).
  Similarly, the only term that depends on \(D^{k}f(x)\) is \(g'(f(x))\circ D^{k}f(x)\).
  All other derivatives of \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable,
  hence Lipschitz continuous near \(a\) and \(f(a)\), respectively.
  Therefore, \(D^{k}g(f(x))\circ_{k}f'(x) - D^{k}g(f(a))\circ_{k}f'(a)=O\left(\|x - a\|^{\alpha}\right)\) as \(x\to a\).
  This immediately implies the required estimate.
\end{proof}
